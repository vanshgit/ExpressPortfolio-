          <h3>Survey Form</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I have meticulously crafted a survey form using CSS that aims to
            provide a visually appealing and intuitive user experience. With
            careful attention to detail, I have applied stylish and modern
            design elements, such as responsive layouts, thoughtfully chosen
            fonts, and pleasing color schemes. By employing CSS techniques, I
            have ensured that the form is easily navigable, with clear labels,
            well-aligned input fields, and visually distinct sections.
            Additionally, I have incorporated appropriate hover effects and
            transitions to enhance interactivity and guide users through the
            survey seamlessly. With a focus on both functionality and
            aesthetics, my CSS-designed survey form offers a user-friendly and
            visually engaging interface that encourages participation and
            provides a pleasant experience for respondents.

          <h3>Basic Banking System</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I have developed a basic banking system using the Express framework,
            which enables the implementation of robust and efficient web
            applications. Leveraging the power of Express, I have created
            endpoints and routes that handle various banking operations. These
            include functionalities such as user authentication, account
            creation, fund transfers, transaction history retrieval, and balance
            management. By integrating middleware and validation techniques, I
            have ensured the security and reliability of the system. With
            Express's flexibility and scalability, my banking system provides a
            seamless and user-friendly experience for customers, empowering them
            to perform essential financial tasks with ease.

          <h3>TV Show Search</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I have designed and developed a TV show search application that
            allows users to explore and discover their favorite shows with ease.
            Leveraging various technologies and APIs, I have built a
            user-friendly interface that enables users to search for TV shows
            based on different criteria such as title, genre, and actors. The
            application retrieves relevant information about each show,
            including details such as plot summaries, episode guides, and
            ratings. By implementing responsive design principles, the
            application seamlessly adapts to different devices, ensuring a
            consistent and enjoyable user experience across desktops, tablets,
            and mobile devices. Through this TV show search application, users
            can effortlessly find and explore their desired shows, enhancing
            their entertainment experience.
